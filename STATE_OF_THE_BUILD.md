## OVERALL STATUS

```
Governance documents:    COMPLETE (12 files)
Feature specs:           COMPLETE (52 files)
FORGE queue:             Phase 8 built (QuickBooks stubbed/deferred, Vercel deploy
                         prep done). ALL PHASES (0–8) NOW BUILT.
Application code:        Phases 0–8 built (see BUILD PHASE STATUS).
Database migration:      supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql (all 35 tables,
                         RLS + FK indexes), 002_seed_afs_data.sql (materials/gauges/
                         product_profiles reference data), 003_pricing_rules_cost_notes.sql
                         (renamed from 002 to preserve numeric order). Not yet applied to
                         a live Supabase project — see supabase/README.md to run.
API keys in .env.local:  Present locally (not committed). STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
                         STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, and NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
                         are all confirmed populated with live-mode values (sk_live_/
                         whsec_/pk_live_ prefixes) as of afs-026 — the empty-Stripe-key
                         condition logged in afs-025 no longer applies. Stripe checkout/
                         webhooks are live-key-ready.
pnpm install:            DONE (afs-025) — stripe, @stripe/stripe-js,
                         @stripe/react-stripe-js, docx all present in
                         pnpm-lock.yaml and node_modules.
pnpm tsc --noEmit:       PASSES — 0 errors (afs-030, re-verified after every change).
pnpm run build:          PASSES — exit 0, all 98 routes generated (afs-030 — +6 vs.
                         afs-029's 92: /studio, /studio/draft, /api/admin/pathfinder,
                         /api/admin/pathfinder/push-profile,
                         /api/admin/pathfinder/submit-job, /api/studio/match-profile).
git commits:             All work through afs-030 is committed and pushed to
                         origin/main. Working tree is clean.
Design system:           The afs-027 site-wide light silver rebrand was REVERTED
                         (afs-028, `git revert b3512f1`) back to the original dark
                         gunmetal theme per explicit instruction ("light theme was
                         applied in error") — DESIGN_TOKENS.md, tailwind.config.js,
                         and app/globals.css are back to their pre-afs-027 dark
                         values. afs-029 then applied a small, explicitly-scoped
                         patch on top of the reverted dark theme: app/(public)/
                         products/page.tsx, app/configure/page.tsx, and
                         app/quote/page.tsx each have their main content-area div
                         given an inline `style={{ backgroundColor: '#B8BEC8' }}`
                         (a one-off arbitrary value, not a token, per explicit
                         instruction to touch nothing else) and their page
                         title/subtitle recolored to text-afs-crimson font-bold /
                         text-black font-bold. afs-030 (this build) re-added just
                         the afs-ink-900 (#111111) / afs-ink-700 (#374151) token
                         pair — removed by the afs-028 revert — because the new
                         FlashDraft canvas tool needs dark dimension-label text on
                         its light drawing surface; the rest of the site remains
                         dark gunmetal. See SESSION_STATE.md for the full afs-027
                         → afs-028 → afs-029 → afs-030 sequence.
Design Studio:           NEW (afs-030) — app/studio (tab-card landing page) +
                         app/studio/draft (FlashDraft canvas tool), backed by a new
                         machine profile library imported from the shop's actual
                         Thalmann DS2801 bending machine database. See BUILD PHASE
                         STATUS below for full detail. PathfinderEdge machine-control
                         integration was investigated live and found to have no
                         discoverable REST API — stubbed, not implemented, exactly
                         like the QuickBooks precedent.

                                        confirmation (#52-54) — stubbed, not fully
                                        implemented: lib/integrations/quickbooks.ts

                                        "Integrations" section. Supabase integration
                                        (SPEC_SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md) is functionally
                                        done via lib/supabase/{client,server,admin}.ts +
                                        the 3 migrations. Vercel deploy prep done:
                                        vercel.json created (framework: nextjs, pnpm
                                        build/install/dev commands, no cron entries —

                                        — no change needed.

Design Studio (afs-030) —                NEW, beyond BLUEPRINT.md's original 9-phase
  not one of Phase 0-8:                  queue. Three parts:

  1. Thalmann machine profile import:    supabase/migrations/004_machine_profiles.sql
                                        (machine_profile_categories, machine_profiles,
                                        machine_profile_bends, RLS: authenticated read
                                        on is_public rows, admin read/write all — NOT
                                        yet applied to the live Supabase project, see
                                        supabase/README.md). scripts/import-machine-
                                        profiles.ts reads machine-data/ds2801db.bdb (a
                                        real Microsoft Jet/Access database despite its
                                        unusual extension — confirmed via magic bytes)
                                        via the mdb-reader npm package instead of the
                                        system mdbtools CLI (no apt-get/mdbtools
                                        available in this Windows dev environment).
                                        IMPORTANT: this source file is the shop's
                                        actual job history, not a clean generic
                                        catalog — most of its 911 profiles are named
                                        after real customers/projects (hospitals,
                                        churches, individual clients), including
                                        inside categories with generic-sounding names
                                        like "DRIP EDGE" or "VALLEY". Only categories
                                        23 (Rheinzink-Profile → Zinc Profiles) and
                                        42-61 (the numbered "00"-"19" series →
                                        Standard Series 0-19) are imported
                                        is_public = true; everything else is
                                        is_public = false. Within the public
                                        categories, any individual profile whose name
                                        doesn't resolve to a recognized generic term
                                        is also forced private (a handful of profiles
                                        even there — "Messe", "Toli", "HAM", "SHOP
                                        SINK", "1407 BURFORD" — read as personal
                                        nicknames or job addresses, not generic
                                        templates). machine-data/ itself is gitignored
                                        — the raw file is real customer data and was
                                        never committed. `pnpm run import:machine-
                                        profiles` is documented but not run against
                                        the live database (Part 5 instruction: do not

                                        the SQL Editor first, per supabase/README.md).

  2. PathfinderEdge integration:         lib/integrations/pathfinder-edge.ts +
                                        app/api/admin/pathfinder/{route,push-profile/
                                        route,submit-job/route}.ts. A live discovery
                                        pass was run (with explicit user
                                        authorization) against the configured API key
                                        and https://afs.pathfinderedge.com: the host
                                        is real (Azure/Kestrel), but `/` redirects to

                                        404 — no discoverable API surface. Stubbed
                                        exactly like lib/integrations/quickbooks.ts:
                                        all 5 functions (discoverApiEndpoints,
                                        getPathfinderCatalogs, pushProfileToPathfinder,
                                        submitJobToMachine, getJobStatus) return
                                        'not_configured', zero network calls. This
                                        matters because submitJobToMachine would
                                        otherwise drive a real physical bending
                                        machine (serial P0700707) from a fabricated,
                                        undocumented request format.

  3. FlashDraft + Design Studio UI:      app/studio/page.tsx (3 tab cards: Scan to
                                        Quote → /upload, Photo to Quote →

                                        /studio/draft). app/studio/draft/page.tsx —
                                        two-panel canvas tool (380px controls + flex
                                        canvas, min 600×500): draw/select/erase modes,
                                        15°-angle and 1/8"-dimension snapping, Ctrl+Z/

                                        Space+drag pan, per-segment length editing,
                                        1/4" grid, profile drawn in afs-crimson with
                                        dimension/angle labels in afs-ink-900 (re-added
                                        this token pair specifically for this canvas
                                        use — see Design system note above), debounced
                                        (500ms) profile matching against
                                        app/api/studio/match-profile/route.ts (scores
                                        public machine_profiles by bend count + angle
                                        + leg-length similarity, returns top 3), Save
                                        Draft (localStorage), Load from Library
                                        (queries public machine_profiles client-side,

                                        /api/quote-requests endpoint). Added to
                                        NavBar.tsx between "Upload Drawing" and
                                        "Architects". Visually verified — drew a test
                                        L-shaped profile via Playwright, confirmed
                                        snapping/labels/undo render correctly, zero
                                        console errors; the profile-match panel
                                        correctly shows its empty state since
                                        machine_profiles doesn't exist in the live DB
                                        yet (migration not applied — expected, not
                                        a bug).

## DNS MIGRATION CHECKLIST
When migrating DNS to the live domain, these must be updated BEFORE go-live:

1. Vercel Environment Variables — update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL from https://afs-website-alpha.vercel.app to the live domain
2. Supabase Auth — update Site URL in Authentication settings to the live domain
3. Stripe webhook endpoint URL — update in Stripe dashboard to the live domain
4. Redeploy on Vercel after env var change

## NEXT ACTION

**All 9 original build phases (0–8) are built. The design system is back to
its original dark gunmetal theme (afs-028 reverted afs-027's light rebrand).
A new, tenth body of work — the Design Studio (Thalmann profile import,
FlashDraft canvas tool, PathfinderEdge stub) — was added in afs-030.** The
tool-approval gate logged in afs-023/024 has not recurred since afs-025.

1. **Done (afs-030 — this build):** Design Studio. See BUILD PHASE STATUS
   above for full detail: `supabase/migrations/004_machine_profiles.sql`
   (not yet applied to the live project — paste into SQL Editor per
   `supabase/README.md`, then run `pnpm run import:machine-profiles`),
   `app/studio` + `app/studio/draft` (FlashDraft canvas), `app/api/studio/
   match-profile`, `lib/integrations/pathfinder-edge.ts` (stub — no real
   PathfinderEdge API was discoverable) + its 3 admin routes, NavBar entry.
   Re-added `afs-ink-900`/`afs-ink-700` tokens (only these two) for the
   FlashDraft canvas's dimension labels. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) and
   `pnpm run build` (exit 0, 98/98 routes) both pass; visually verified.
2. **Done (afs-029):** Scoped fix on top of the reverted dark theme —
   `app/(public)/products/page.tsx`, `app/configure/page.tsx`,
   `app/quote/page.tsx` each got an inline `#B8BEC8` background on their
   main content div and `text-afs-crimson font-bold` / `text-black
   font-bold` titles/subtitles, per an explicitly narrow instruction
   ("do not touch any other file/token"). Not committed to governance docs
   at the time per that instruction's own scope — logged here now for
   completeness.
3. **Done (afs-028):** `git revert b3512f1` — reverted the afs-027 site-wide
   light rebrand back to the original dark gunmetal theme per explicit
   instruction. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm run build` both re-verified
   passing after the revert.
4. **Remaining — not a code task:** `supabase/migrations/*` (all 4, including
   the new 004) have not been applied to a live Supabase project yet.
5. Confirm chat_conversations retention policy (#65) before relying on
   chat history persistence in production.
6. If/when the client confirms QuickBooks scope (checklist #52-54) or a
   real PathfinderEdge API is documented, build the real integrations out
   against the existing stub function signatures in `lib/integrations/
   quickbooks.ts` and `lib/integrations/pathfinder-edge.ts`.
7. If further profile data is needed publicly, a human should review the
   ~850 profiles imported as `is_public = false` (real customer/project
   job history) and selectively flip specific ones to public — do not
   bulk-flip the category default, per the privacy audit in afs-030.
8. DATA BLOCKERS table below is the remaining pre-launch punch list —
   nothing left is a FORGE code task; all remaining items need data/assets
   from the client.

Historical detail on the afs-023 → afs-027 sequence (build-blocker
investigation, the two real build bugs fixed in afs-025, and the full
afs-027 light-rebrand build) is preserved in SESSION_STATE.md's SESSION LOG.
